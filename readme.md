# Introduction to Bash

What's up! **Bash** is a shell scripting language used primarily on Unix and Linux operating systems. It can be written directly at the command line (or any text editor) and it has the power to massively speed up your workflow. Everything from *automating tasks* to *running programs* and .... *running fMRI analyses* can be accomplished simply and effectively with **bash**.

Shell script files are denoted with .sh after the filename.

Make sure to include the shebang tag - **#!/usr/bin/env bash** at the top of any script that you want your machine to interpret as Bash code.
